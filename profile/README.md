# Welcome to Codamor 🎉

**Codamor** presents the development projects that I carry out to deepen my knowledge in development 🧑‍💻.

Most projects focus on one main goal 🎯 to achieve.

It can be:
- put new knowledge into practice 💡,
- discover a library or a framework ⚙️,
- implement an algorithm 👷,
- understand a concept 🤔.

Any constructive criticism is welcome 🙏
